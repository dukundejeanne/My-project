           <h3>About Me</h3>

           <p>When I was young girl I liked computers and I wanted to know how to use it and learn more
                about it. However, at that time computer science was a course for boys only. We had very few
                women working in an Information Technology field. Therefore, when I presented my idea of
                studying Computer Science to my parents, the rejected it as they could. For them they had a plan
                for me, they wanted me to be an Accountant, or a teacher as many girls in my country did at the
                time. Consequently, I ended up studying Mathematics and Chemistry because my parents wanted
                me to be a Chemistry teacher in the future. Meanwhile, my desire of studying Computer Science
                kept growing in me. This made me make a big impactful decision when I got to college, I
                decided to study Information Technology and my main interest was about data security.</p>
